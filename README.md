## Autocomplete Library

The Autocomplete library is a JavaScript library that provides autocomplete functionality for search fields. It suggests search queries based on a search history and allows users to select from the suggestions.

Live demo: [https://dev-s1-ekipa.netlify.app](https://dev-s1-ekipa.netlify.app)

This library was developed for the `Weekly Coding Challenge` 3th edition organized by Teckzara Community.

### Demo with empty search history

Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Autocomplete library in action.

### Demo with pre-populated search history

The Autocomplete library comes with a demo HTML file called `demo.html`, which you can use to test the functionality. In the demo file, there is an existing search history with the following queries:

- "Macbook 2023"
- "Macbook 2023 Pro Max"
- "anana sy hena"
- "anana sy ovy ary hena"
- "hena sy anana"

You can open the `demo.html` file in your web browser to see the Autocomplete library in action and interact with the search field to test the autocomplete suggestions based on the provided search history.

### Features

- Auto-suggests search queries based on a search history.
- Uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to calculate the similarity between search queries.
- Saves search queries to local storage for persistence.

### Usage in your project

To use the Autocomplete library, follow these steps:

1. Include the Autocomplete library in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/autocomplete.css" />
<script src="./src/autocomplete.js"></script>
```

2. Initialize the Autocomplete library by calling the `init` method with the ID of the form element that contains the autocomplete functionality:

```javascript
const searchAutocomplete = Autocomplete().init("form-autocomplete");
```

Make sure to replace `"form-autocomplete"` with the actual ID of your form element.

3. Set up the necessary HTML structure:

```html
<form id="form-autocomplete">
  <div class="form-control">
    <input type="text" class="input-search" placeholder="Rechercher..." />
    <button type="submit" class="btn-search">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#8b8b8b" d="M21.71 20.29L18 16.61A9 9 0 1 0 16.61 18l3.68 3.68a1 1 0 0 0 1.42 0a1 1 0 0 0 0-1.39ZM11 18a7 7 0 1 1 7-7a7 7 0 0 1-7 7Z"/></svg>
  </div>

  <div class="autocomplete-results">
    <ul class="autocomplete-results-list"></ul>
  </div>
</form>
```

Ensure that you have an input field with the class `"input-search"`, an unordered list with the class `"autocomplete-results-list"`, and optionally, a button with the class `"btn-search"` for submitting the form.

4. Customize the library (optional):

You can modify the following properties of the Autocomplete library:

- `debugMode`: Set it to `true` to enable debug logs.
- `maxLevenshteinDistance`: Set the maximum Levenshtein distance allowed for a search query to be considered a suggestion.
- `searchHistoryId`: Change the ID used to store the search history in local storage.
